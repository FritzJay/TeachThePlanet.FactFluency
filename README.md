Order of routes: Login -> SelectTest -> StartTest -> TakeTest -> TestResults

The files for each route are located at "src/Routes/<Name Of Route>/<Name Of Route>.<tsx, test.tsx, scss>"
For example, the sass file for the Login route is located at "src/Routes/Login/Login.scss"

Components are organized in a similar folder structure at "src/Component/<Component Name>/<Component Name>.<tsx, test.tsx, scss>"
For example, the tsx file for the TestNumber component is located at "src/Component/TestNumber/TestNumber.tsx
